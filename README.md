# SPORTSSTATS
  PROJECT PROPOSAL FOR SPORTSSTAS (Olympics Dataset - 120 years of data)
I noticed that in certain years ('1994', '1998', '2002', '2006', '2010', '2014')
there were great decline in number of male and female athletes compared to the other years
('1996', '2000', '2004', '2008', '2012', '2016'). 
I noticed a seasonality change but i dont think the criteria is enough to cause the number of athletes in the various categories.
